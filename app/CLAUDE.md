# Hotbox — Mobile App (`app/`)

The customer-facing Expo app. Shared repo rules (git workflow, guardrails) live in the root [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Commands

Run from inside `app/`.

- **Install:** `pnpm install`
- **Dev / run:** `pnpm web` (also `pnpm start`, `pnpm android`, `pnpm ios`)
- **Lint:** `pnpm lint`
- **Typecheck:** `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit`

# Expo Instructions

This is an Expo/React Native mobile application. Prioritize mobile-first patterns, performance, and cross-platform compatibility.

## Expo has changed — do not trust your training data

Expo ships breaking changes every SDK release. APIs you remember are likely renamed, moved, or removed. Before writing any code that touches an Expo, EAS, or React Native API:

1. Read the major version of the `expo` package in `app/package.json`.
2. Fetch the matching versioned docs: `https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v<major>.0.0/`
3. For anything else, fetch https://docs.expo.dev/llms.txt — an index of all Expo docs with corrections to common LLM misconceptions. Follow its links to the specific page you need; never answer from memory.

## Expo CLI

```bash
pnpm expo install <package>  # ALWAYS use instead of pnpm add — resolves SDK-compatible versions
pnpm expo start              # start the dev server
pnpm expo lint               # lint
pnpm exec tsc --noEmit       # typecheck
pnpm dlx expo-doctor         # diagnose dependency and config issues
pnpm expo install --fix      # fix incompatible package versions
```

## Navigation & Routing

- Use **Expo Router** for all navigation. Routes live in `src/app/` — every file there is a screen, `_layout.tsx` files define navigators. Keep non-route code (components, hooks, utils) outside `src/app/` (in `src/components/`, `src/hooks/`, `src/constants/`).
- Import `Link`, `router`, and `useLocalSearchParams` from `expo-router`.
- Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction.md

## Building with EAS

Use EAS to build, sign, and submit the app in the cloud (`eas build`, `eas submit`) and to ship over-the-air updates (`eas update`) — no local Xcode or Android Studio required. Run EAS CLI as `pnpm dlx eas-cli@latest <command>`; substitute that for bare `eas` in docs examples.
Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/eas/index.md

## Rules

- If `ios/` and `android/` directories do not exist, they are generated (Continuous Native Generation). Never create or edit them by hand — configure native behavior in `app.json` and config plugins.
- Expo Go only includes its bundled native modules. After adding a library with native code, the app needs a development build: `pnpm expo run:ios|android` locally, or `eas build --profile development`.
- Prefer recommended Expo modules over third-party libraries, and check your available skills before adding dependencies. Docs: https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/index.md
